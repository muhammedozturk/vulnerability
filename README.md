# vulnerability
cosine similarity-based vulnerability detection

A new labeling algorithm to be used in vulnerability detection is proposed. That method can perform labeling by analyzing source codes written in C\#, Java, and C programming languages. The proposed framework can also generate a word2vec matrix encoded by searching a folder and its sub-folders to the end of depth. An ultimate matrix combined with a labeling vector are created for the algorithms devised.
