cosine similarity-based vulnerability detection
NOTE: .TXT files are word2vec lists created for public use.

A new labeling algorithm to be used in vulnerability detection is proposed. That method can perform labeling by analyzing source codes written in C\#, Java, and C programming languages. The proposed framework can also generate a word2vec matrix encoded by searching a folder and its sub-folders to the end of depth. An ultimate matrix combined with a labeling vector are created for the algorithms devised.

1. First get execute average vector values,
2. Perform label rules,
3. Perform grid search to find optimal hyperparameters,
4. Create labels with cosine similarity,
5. Perform vulnerability prediction.
